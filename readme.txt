 * KaiserStream: A Feature-Rich Movie Streaming Single-Page Application
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * This file contains the complete React application for KaiserStream, a modern movie streaming website.
 * It is designed as a single-file application for portability and ease of setup.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
 * - Dynamic Content: Fetches trending, latest, and popular content from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
 * - Custom Router: A simple yet effective page navigation system managed with React state.
 * - Component-Based Architecture: Cleanly structured into pages, UI components, and icons.
 * - State Management: Utilizes React Context for global state (authentication, watchlist, navigation).
 * - User Authentication: A mock serial key system for user login.
 * - Interactive UI: Includes carousels, modals, skeleton loaders, and a mobile-friendly menu.
 * - Obfuscated Keys: API and serial keys are Base64 encoded to deter casual inspection.
 *
 * --- IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DEPLOYMENT & GITHUB ---
 *
 * 1.  **Security Warning:** The API key and serial keys are obfuscated using Base64 encoding.
 * This is NOT true encryption and is not secure for a production build where the code is
 * publicly accessible. For a real-world application, sensitive keys should be stored in
 * backend environment variables and accessed via a secure API layer.
 *
 * 2.  **API Key:** The included TMDb API key is a publicly available key for development purposes.
 * It is recommended to register for your own free key at https://www.themoviedb.org/.
 *
 * 3.  **Single-File Structure:** This project is intentionally built in a single file. For larger, more
 * complex applications, it is standard practice to split components, hooks, and contexts
 * into separate files and directories.
 *
 * 4.  **Valid Serial Keys for Testing:**
